# Tesla Energy Data Project
**Summary**

This project focuses on solving the problem of identifying malfunctioning Energy Production Sites by

Built an ETL pipeline to collect signal data through 2 Energy Realtime Data API Endpoints
Collected 29 hours historical data
Provided a Plotly Dash dashboard for visualizing data from 42 sites
Proposed solutions for more in-depth Anomaly Detection
This Notebook will explain this project in the following order:

**Part** 1. ETL Pipeline Building

**Part** 2. Data Processing & Plotly Visualization

**Part** 3. Analysis and Insights on Malfunctioning Sites

**Part** 4. More Anomaly Detection Thoughts

Please reference jupyter notebook for more documentation for this project.
